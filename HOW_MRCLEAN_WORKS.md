## ü§ñ Real Model Training <a name="real-model-training"></a>

### What Really Happens When You Train Models

```python
# STEP 1: Feature Engineering (200+ features created)
leverage_ratio = limit / retention                    # Risk leverage
rate_on_line = premium / limit                       # Pricing efficiency  
combined_ratio = loss_ratio + expense_ratio          # Profitability metric
geographic_concentration = HHI_index(territories)    # Concentration risk
cedant_quality_score = rating * persistency * claims_history

# STEP 2: Machine Learning Algorithms

## Random Forest (What it actually does):
- Creates 100 decision trees
- Each tree learns different patterns
- Example Tree #1: "If Property AND California ‚Üí High CAT risk"
- Example Tree #2: "If loss_ratio > 80% AND expense > 30% ‚Üí Unprofitable"
- Final prediction = Average of all 100 trees

## Gradient Boosting (Sequential learning):
Iteration 1: Basic premium = $1M
Iteration 2: Oops, missed CAT risk, add $200K
Iteration 3: Overcharged for good cedant, reduce $50K
Final: Premium = $1.15M

# STEP 3: Model Validation
- Training set: 80% of data (24 treaties)
- Test set: 20% of data (6 treaties)
- Cross-validation: Train 5 times on different splits
- R¬≤ = 0.85 means: Model explains 85% of premium variance
```

### Actual Code That Runs:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# This is what actually happens
model = RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,      # 100 trees
    max_depth=10,          # Each tree can ask 10 questions
    min_samples_split=5    # Need 5+ treaties to split
)

# Training process
X = features_dataframe  # 200+ columns of features
y = target_premiums     # Actual premiums to predict
model.fit(X, y)         # Learn patterns

# Prediction
new_treaty_features = [leverage_ratio, loss_ratio, ...]
predicted_premium = model.predict([new_treaty_features])
```

## üí∞ Pricing Calculations <a name="pricing-calculations"></a>

### Exact Formula Mr.Clean Uses

#### **Quota Share Pricing (30% Cession Example)**

```
Given:
- Portfolio Premium: $10,000,000
- Historical Loss Ratio: 72%
- Cession Rate: 30%
- Commission: 25%
- Brokerage: 3%

Calculations:
1. Ceded Premium = $10M √ó 30% = $3,000,000
2. Expected Losses = 72% √ó $3M = $2,160,000
3. Acquisition Costs = $3M √ó (25% + 3%) = $840,000
4. Technical Premium = $2,160,000 + $840,000 = $3,000,000
5. Risk Loading = Volatility √ó Capital √ó ROE
   = 0.15 √ó $3M √ó 0.15 = $67,500
6. Commercial Premium = $3,067,500

Metrics:
- Loss Ratio = $2.16M / $3.07M = 70.4%
- Expense Ratio = $840K / $3.07M = 27.4%
- Combined Ratio = 97.8%
- Profit Margin = 2.2%
```

#### **Excess of Loss Pricing**

```
Given:
- Attachment: $1,000,000
- Limit: $10,000,000
- Historical Large Losses: 5 in 10 years

Calculations:
1. Layer Coverage = $10M - $1M = $9,000,000
2. Frequency = 5/10 = 0.5 losses per year
3. Severity = Average loss in layer = $2,000,000
4. Expected Loss = 0.5 √ó $2M = $1,000,000
5. Volatility Load = sqrt(0.5) √ó $2M √ó 0.3 = $424,264
6. Commercial Premium = $1,424,264
```

#### **Life Insurance Pricing**

```
Given:
- Age: 45, Male, Non-smoker
- Face Amount: $1,000,000
- Product: 20-Year Term

Calculations:
1. Base Mortality (qx) = 0.003 (3 deaths per 1000)
2. Present Value Death Benefit = $1M √ó 0.003 √ó PV(20) = $45,000
3. Expense Loading = 30% of pure premium = $13,500
4. Profit Margin = 15% = $8,775
5. Annual Premium = $67,275 / 12 = $5,606/month
```

### Mortality Tables

```python
# SOA 2015 VBT Implementation
def mortality_rate(age, gender, smoking):
    base_qx = VBT_2015[age][gender]
    
    if smoking:
        qx = base_qx * 2.5  # Smoker multiple
    else:
        qx = base_qx * 0.6  # Non-smoker discount
    
    return qx

# Life Expectancy Calculation
def life_expectancy(age, gender):
    survival = 1.0
    expected_years = 0
    
    for future_age in range(age, 120):
        qx = mortality_rate(future_age, gender, False)
        expected_years += survival * (1 - qx)
        survival *= (1 - qx)
    
    return expected_years
```

### Reserve Calculations

```python
# Policy Reserve (Simplified GAAP)
def calculate_reserve(face_amount, age, duration):
    # Present value of future benefits
    pvfb = sum([
        face_amount * mortality_rate(age + t) * discount(t)
        for t in range(duration)
    ])
    
    # Present value of future premiums
    pvfp = sum([
        annual_premium * survival_rate(age, t) * discount(t)
        for t in range(duration)
    ])
    
    reserve = pvfb - pvfp
    return max(0, reserve)  # Reserve can't be negative
```

### Interest Rate Curves

```python
# Treasury Curve + Spread
def discount_rate(duration, product_type):
    treasury_curve = {
        1: 0.045,
        5: 0.048,
        10: 0.052,
        20: 0.055,
        30: 0.058
    }
    
    credit_spread = {
        "AAA": 0.003,
        "AA": 0.005,
        "A": 0.008,
        "BBB": 0.012
    }
    
    base_rate = interpolate(treasury_curve, duration)
    spread = credit_spread.get(rating, 0.01)
    
    return base_rate + spread
```
